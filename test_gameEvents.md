# `test_gameEvents.js`

This file contains unit tests for the `handleGameEvents` function, which is responsible for handling game-related events in the application. The tests ensure that the function behaves correctly under various scenarios.

## Dependencies

- **Modules Tested**:
  - `handleGameEvents` (from `../gameEvents`)

- **Mocked Modules**:
  - `../store`:
    - `getMembers`
    - `getRoomCode`
    - `isCreator`
    - `isGameStarted`
    - `startGame`

- **Testing Framework**:
  - Jest

## Test Suite: `handleGameEvents`

### Setup and Teardown

- **`beforeEach`**:
  - Initializes a mock `socket` object with:
    - `send`: A mock function to simulate sending messages.
    - `_socket.remoteAddress`: A mock IP address (`127.0.0.1`).

- **`afterEach`**:
  - Clears all mock function calls to ensure test isolation.

### Tests

1. **`should start the game`**
   - Verifies that the game starts successfully when:
     - The user is in a room.
     - The user is the room creator.
     - There are enough players in the room.
     - The game has not already started.
   - Ensures the following functions are called:
     - `getRoomCode`
     - `isCreator`
     - `getMembers`
     - `isGameStarted`
     - `startGame`
   - Confirms the `socket.send` function sends a `"game-started"` message.

2. **`should not start the game if not in a room`**
   - Ensures the game does not start if the user is not in a room.
   - Verifies that `socket.send` sends an error message.

3. **`should not start the game if not the creator`**
   - Ensures the game does not start if the user is not the room creator.
   - Verifies that `socket.send` sends an error message.

4. **`should not start the game if not enough players`**
   - Ensures the game does not start if there are fewer than two players in the room.
   - Verifies that `socket.send` sends an error message.

5. **`should not start the game if already started`**
   - Ensures the game does not start if it has already been started.
   - Verifies that `socket.send` sends an error message.

## Mocked Functions

- **`getRoomCode`**:
  - Returns the room code associated with the socket.

- **`isCreator`**:
  - Checks if the user is the creator of the room.

- **`getMembers`**:
  - Returns the list of members in the room.

- **`isGameStarted`**:
  - Checks if the game has already started.

- **`startGame`**:
  - Starts the game for the specified room.

## File Purpose

The purpose of this file is to ensure that the `handleGameEvents` function behaves as expected in various scenarios, including edge cases. It validates the logic for starting a game and ensures proper error handling when conditions are not met.
